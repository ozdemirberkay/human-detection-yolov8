# Human Detection from Images Using YOLOv8

This project uses the YOLOv8 model, trained on a custom dataset, to detect humans in images.


## Dataset

The model was trained using the [Human Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/human-dataset) available on Kaggle.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**
